# Smart Attendance Management using Face Recognition. 


* In this project, KNN Classification is to identify whether the person is absent or present. KNN is a supervised method used for classification. 

* Two files called add_faces.py and test.py are created. In add_faces new user will be added. First, the name of the new user is taken as an input and then 100 images of the user are captured. 

* An inbuilt file 'data/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' is used to
save the captured face features of the new user. This data is saved in a pickle file.

* Next, the test.py file is to be executed where the actual prediction of the user's face takes place. 

* Code Description.pdf file contains detailed working of the code. 

## Output

+ Add a new User.
